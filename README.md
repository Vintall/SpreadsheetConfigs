6. In "Published content & settings" you have several fields.
	- First of all, choose entire document in first field. 
	- You most likely want to have enabled "Automatically republish when changes are made". Otherwise you will need to republish it manually every time. 
	- Press "Start publishing" to generate link to your sheet.
